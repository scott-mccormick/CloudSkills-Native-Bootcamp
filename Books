The DEvOps Handbook
Part 1
Introduction
DevOps and its resulting technical, architectural, and cultural practices represent a convergence of many philosophical and management movements.
DevOps is the outcome of applying the most trusted principles from the domains of physical manufacturing and leadership to the IT value stream.
While the foundation of DevOps can be seen as been derived from Lean, the Theory of Constraints, and the Toyota Kata movement, many also view DevOps as the logical continuation of the Agile software journey.
The Lean Movement
Major tenets:
The manufacturing lead time required to convert raw materials into finished goods is the best predictor of quality, customer satisfaction, and employee happiness.
One of the best predictors of short lead time is small batch sizes of work.
Systems thinking:
Constancy of purpose
Scientific thinking
flow and pull (versus push)
assuring quality at the source
leading with humility
respecting every individual
The Agile Manifesto
A lightweight set of values and principles applied software development processes.
Key principles:
Deliver working software frequently
Small size batches
Incremental releases
Small, self-motivated teams
High-trust management model
